- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lorenzo0224, a phd candidate at HIT.
- 👀 I’m interested in data preparation for ML, Data Analysis and SQL Query.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build a data integration pipeline, hopefully with interesting features. 
- 💞️ I’m also interested in magic, so maybe I can show you a little magic trick if you meet me in person:)
