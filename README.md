- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lorenzo0224, a phd candidate from the Massive Data Computing lab at Harbin Institute of Technology.
- 👀 I’m interested in big data algorithms and management, currently focusing on data preparation for Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I’m learning to build a data integration pipeline cooperating with students in our group. 
- 💞️ I’m also interested in magic, so maybe I can show you a little magic trick if you meet me in person:)
